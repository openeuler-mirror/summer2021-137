## How to add/remove software (repository) in one SIG

### Scenario

As long as the SIG is growing, it may try to introduce more software (repository). This helps to build openEuler ecosystem. 

In openEuler community, the relationship between SIG and projects (software repositories) is maintained in <https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/blob/master/sig/sigs.yaml>. 

And the projects (software repositories) are defined in <https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/repository>. 

So, if you need add or remove software in one SIG, you need to create one PR to modify the 2 files:

[1] <https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/blob/master/sig/sigs.yaml>

[2] <https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/blob/master/repository/openeuler.yaml> or <https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/blob/master/repository/src-openeuler.yaml>.
