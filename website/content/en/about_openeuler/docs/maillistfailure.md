## Cannot subscribe the mail lists. What can I do?

### Quick answer

In one word, send email to <infra@openeuler.org> and the team will help you.

### What failures frequently happened?

#### 1. I subsribe it but nothing received. 

Please check the *transh* box of your email. Some email server may filter it to transh. 

#### 2. I received "409 Conflict"

```
{"title": "409 Conflict", "description": "Subscription request already pending"}

```

It is because you might have subscribed before, but didn't reply the confirmation email, and you tried it again but the session is not closed.

Sorry, but pleses send email to <infra@openeuler.org> for help.
