## What is openEuler?
The openEuler is an open source, free Linux distribution platform that will work with developers around the world to build an open, diverse and architecturally inclusive software ecosystem in the form of an open community. At the same time, openEuler is also an innovative platform where anyone is encouraged to come up with new ideas, pioneer new ideas and practice new solutions.

 [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)  is a famous mathematician, and one of his most famous contributions is [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) which establishes a link between the five numbers 0, 1, Pi, e, i, which is in line with the mission of the operating system, which is to run real-world business in the digital world and be a bridge between the digital world and the real world. openEuler carries the dream of developers to build open source open software systems.
